## Generate Executable File

- First open console in directory.
- Run the command "qmake". This generates a Makefile.
- Run the command "make" to generate a executable file with the Makefile.
- To execute the file run the command "./#nameOfFile#"

## Troubleshooting
- Program won't run: Maybe you don't have root rights. Just add "sudo ./#nameOfFile#" to your execute command
